# Anmeldetool - Event Registration System

A web-based event registration system designed for organizations that need to manage recurring event registrations with email-based access control.

## What This Application Does

This application solves the problem of collecting event registrations from a group of people in a structured, organized way. It's particularly suited for sports clubs, youth organizations, or community groups that run multiple events throughout the year.

### Business Scenario

**Example:** A youth sports club (TV Erlach - Jugi) runs various training sessions and events throughout the year. Every season, they need to know which members want to participate in which events.

Instead of managing spreadsheets, phone calls, or paper forms, administrators use this system to:
1. Send personalized registration invitations via email
2. Collect registrations through a simple web form
3. Track who has registered for which events
4. Export registration data for planning purposes

## Core Features

### 1. Person Management
- Maintain a database of people (members, participants, families)
- Store contact information (name, email, date of birth)
- Mark people as active/inactive
- Persons are the recipients of registration invitations

### 2. Event Management
- Create and manage events with details:
  - Title and description
  - Location
  - Date range (from/to dates)
- Events are what people register for (e.g., "Summer Camp", "Saturday Training", "Tournament")

### 3. Registration Periods
- Define registration periods by year with open/close dates
- Select which events are available in this registration period
- Select which persons should receive registration invitations

### 4. Email Invitation System (Magic Links)
- Generate unique, secure links for each person/email address
- No passwords required - recipients access via their personal link
- Email template includes custom text and the unique registration link
- Track which emails have been sent and when
- Resend capability for failed deliveries

### 5. Public Registration Interface
- Recipients click their unique link and see their personal registration form
- View all available events with descriptions, dates, and locations
- Check/uncheck events they want to register for
- Submit registrations (can be modified by clicking the link again)
- Track registration timestamp

### 6. Registration Tracking & Reporting
- View all registrations in a matrix format (persons Ã— events)
- See who has registered for which events
- Track email delivery status
- Export registration data to Excel spreadsheet
- View registration statistics (emails created/sent)

### 7. Security & Access Control

- No authentication required for registration submission
